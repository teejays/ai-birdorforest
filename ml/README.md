# Bird or Forest

This directory represents the machine learning part of the project. It uses Jupyter notebook to fine-tune a neural network. It is based on fastai.

### Usage

If you haven't done so, activate the Python virtual environment.
```bash
source venv-labbirdorforest-ml/bin/activate
```

Start the jupyter server:
```bash
jupyter lab
```

Go to the jupyter lab interface on the browser. 

Run the code in the Jupyter notebook, which will eventually output the `trained_model.pkl`, which can then be copied/linked to the webservice directory, where the webserver can use it for classification.
